# alternative-beacons-ex

A mod for Factorio which overhauls beacons to use exclusion areas in addition to distribution areas, integrates beacons from multiple mods into a single system, and adds (optional) new beacons while preserving the functionality and usefulness of vanilla beacons.

This is a fork of BetweenWalls's Alternative Beacons mod with more settings.
